# vercel-deployment
This is my first deployed full-stack project using vercel
<hr>
<ul>
<li>https://vercel-deployment-client-xi.vercel.app - frontend</li>
<li>https://fastapi-backend-deployment-production.up.railway.app - backend</li>
</ul>
<hr>
P.S. you can check out the swagger of the backend by going to the <b>/docs</b> endpoint of the backend
<hr>
Did not focus on the frontend, but backend and deployment. Further work will be done to improve my frontend skills
