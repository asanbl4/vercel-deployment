# vercel-deployment
This is my first deployed full-stack project using vercel;
vercel-deployment-client-xi.vercel.app - frontend
http://fastapi-beige.vercel.app - backend
P.S. you can check out the swagger of the backend by going to the /docs endpoint of the backend
Did not focus on the frontend, but backend and deployment. Further work will be done to improve my frontend skills
